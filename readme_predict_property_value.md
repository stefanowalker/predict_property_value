# Property Value Predicting
# Previsão de preços de Imóveis

This is a Data App used to display the Machine Learning solution for the Boston property value prediction problem.

The Boston database have is composed by the variables:
- CRIM: Crime rate per capita by city.
- ZN: Proportion of residential land divided by lots over 25,000 square feet.
- INDUS: This is the proportion of hectares of non-commercial businesses per city.
- CHAS: Charles River fictitious variable (= 1 if the section limits the river; 0 otherwise)
- NOX: concentration of nitric oxide (parts per 10 million)
- RM: Average number of rooms between houses in the neighborhood
- AGE: proportion of owner-occupied units built before 1940
- DIS: weighted distances to five job centers in Boston
- RAD: Index of accessibility to radial highways
- TAX: $ 10,000 total property tax rate
- B: 1000 (Bk - 0.63) ², where Bk is the proportion of people of African American descent by city
- PTRATIO: Neighborhoods with a higher proportion of students to teachers (higher value of 'PTRATIO')
- LSTAT: lowest percentage of population status
- MEDV: average value of owner-occupied houses at $ 1000

# Model Building 
Just follow the steps of the code built through Google Colab: testes_models_colab.ipynb.
- First, the base data was explored.
- After data processing.
- Choice of variables that are important to the model.
- Construction of ML models (regression, decision tree, Random Forest).
- The best model was the Radom Forest, which had the lowest mean square error.

At the end, a file (data.csv) was generated with the treated base.
This file is used like input for the application. 

# Application
Built in python 3.7.
Is used the library [streamlit] for making the application.
Besides [Pandas], [Plotly] e [Sklearn].

Run:
```sh
$ streamlit run app.py
```

# TODO 
-Revision in features selection step.
-Model Tunning

# CREDITIS
- This application was built through a set of lessons from the week of data science made by the team of [Minerando Dados].
Gratitude to them!
